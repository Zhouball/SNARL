Requirements: OpenSSL, libmysqlcppconn-dev, libmysqlclient, boost
Please link as specified in the Makefile

1. Basic mysql installation (should bring in libmysqlclient):

sudo apt-get install mysql-server

Start the background server on your local machine with this command:

service mysql start

2. Installing OpenSSL:

sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

3. Installing libmysqlcppconn-dev:

sudo apt-get install libmysqlcppconn-dev

4. Installing boost:

If boost is already inside /usr/include then there is nothing to do. If not, please
download the binary archive and put it in some location. Change the PATHS macro in
the Makefile to reflect this location
